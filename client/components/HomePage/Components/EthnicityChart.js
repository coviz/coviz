              vulnerability to the virus among Black and Hispanic
              Americans...Instead, these groups are more often exposed because
              of social and environmental factors...<br /> Among many other
              vulnerabilities, Black and Hispanic communities and households
              tend to be more crowded; many people work jobs requiring frequent
              contact with others and rely on public transportation.Access to
              health care is poorer than among white Americans, and rates of
              underlying conditions are much higher." -The NYT
