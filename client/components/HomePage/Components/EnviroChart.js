              "The first half of 2020 saw an unprecedented decline in CO2
              emissions -- larger than during the financial crisis of 2008, the
              oil crisis of the 1979, or even World War II." -Zhu Liu,

            <li>
              The biggest drop of carbon emissions in the US during 2020 so far
              occurred during April.
            </li>
            <li>
              "By July 1st, the pandemicâ€™s effects on global emissions
              diminished as lockdown restrictions relaxed and some economic
              activities restarted, [...] with continuing emission declines in the U.S. where coronavirus
              cases are still increasing substantially." -Zhu Liu, nature.com

              "[There are] substantial COVID-related decreases in CO2 emissions between
              January 1st and June 30th of 2020 as compared to 2019. In the
              aggregate, emissions were 8.8% lower." -Zhu Liu, nature.com
