              Definition of Employed, Unemployed & Not In the Labor Force:
              "People who are jobless, looking for a job, and available for work
              are unemployed. The labor force is made up of the employed and the
              unemployed. People who are neither employed nor unemployed are not
              in the labor force."

              "The COVID-19 outbreak and the economic downturn it engendered
              swelled the ranks of unemployed Americans by more than 14 million,
              from 6.2 million in February to 20.5 million in May 2020...The
              rise in the number of unemployed workers due to COVID-19 is
              substantially greater than the increase due to the Great
              Recession."

              "...some economists see three reasons the pandemic’s depressing
              effect on the labor force could linger. First, it appears to have
              sped up some baby boomers’ decision to retire, shrinking the
              number of productive workers in the economy prematurely. Second,
              it is forcing some parents of young children, in particular women,
              to reduce their hours or stop working altogether, which could make
              a comeback harder. Third, it is falling particularly heavily on
              workers with less education and skills. These workers often
              struggle to find well-paying work and many drop out of the
              workforce." <sup className="smallsup">6</sup>
