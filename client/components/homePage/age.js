              As clearly as it is displayed in the visual, the risk of dying
              from Coronavirus increases greatly with age.
            </li>
            <li>
              "COVID-19 is not just hazardous for elderly people, it is
              extremely dangerous for people in their mid-fifties, sixties and
              seventies"
            </li>
            <li>
              The death totals for the 85 and older age group are almost double
              for that of the 50 through 64 year age group.
            </li>
            <li>
              "Children, under the age of 18, to date, account for less than one
              percent of reported COVID-19 deaths"

              health conditions, the capacity of health-care systems, and
              whether the virus has spread among people living in elderly-care
              facilities."
