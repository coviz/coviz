# coviz

Welcome to coviz! Coviz is an interactive data visualization of the impact of COVID-19 over time in the United State, including how it intersects with a variety of key issues. We created coviz as our capstone project during the Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy. It highlights how case counts and deaths have changed in each state since COVID-19 began, and offers users the opportunity to explore how COVID-19 has impacted demographic groups (age, race and ethnicity, gender, and prison populations) and social issues (unemployment, hunger, and the environment).

# Technologies

The site uses D3 to render the main map and additional charts, as well as uses React/Redux for the front end. Additionally, the site uses express/sequelize/SQL for the backend and stores data in a PostgreSQL database. The javascript library fast-csv is used to help read our data files so we can store it in PostgreSQL. To ensure everything is working as expected, code is tested using the Chai BDD/TDD assertion library.

For Deployment, this site is supported by heroku, GitHub, and Travis-CI for continuous integration.
